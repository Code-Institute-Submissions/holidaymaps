Holiday Search

This website helps users search for holiday destinations in Google Maps. It presents a breakdown of Tourist Attractions, Accomodation and Bars And Restaurants.

The website uses bootstrap, Goole Maps API and Google Places API.

The website requires a loading spinner when the search is issued, due to restraints in the Google Maps / Places API.

The loading  spinner is called iosOverlay and is a third party library used for the spinner.
